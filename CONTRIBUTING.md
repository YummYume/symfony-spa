## How to contribute by reporting a bug/proposing a feature?

You can [open an issue](https://github.com/YummYume/symfony-spa/issues/new/choose) with the appropriate template, but make sure a similar issue doesn't already exist.

If no template satisfies you, feel free to create one from scratch, but do include as many details as possible. Never make an empty issue.

## How to contribute to the code?

You should always create a new branch, with an explicit name, and create a pull request once done.

Everything you need to know to use this project and contribute to it is written below.

### Branches

- The [master](https://github.com/YummYume/symfony-spa/tree/master) branch is **not** the default branch. It is used to represent what is currently in _production_.
- The [develop](https://github.com/YummYume/symfony-spa) branch is the default branch. This is the default target branch for pull requests and new branches.
- Other branches are created freely but should respect a certain name coherence, for example, if you are adding a new feature, your branch name should look like `feature/my-feature`.
- **Always** make sure that your branch is up to date with its parent branch before submitting a pull request.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (with Docker Compose).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- This is obvious, but having experience with node/javascript is a must.

### Launch the project locally

> **Warning**  
> Docker is required.

- Fork or clone the project with `git@github.com:YummYume/symfony-spa.git` _OR_ `git@github.com:your-username/symfony-spa.git` if you forked the project.
- Create your own branch from `develop` or any branch other than `master` (eg: `feature/my-feature`).
- Launch the project using `make start` if you have Make installed, or `docker compose build && docker compose up -d` otherwise (you may need additional steps to have the project working, check what's inside the Makefile).
- Go to `http://localhost` to access the app.
- From there, you can add your own code and tests in the appropriate folders.

### What do I need to check before making a PR?

Make sure of the following :

- Your PR is up to date with its parent branch
- Your PR includes tests (not always needed but is very recommended)
- Your PR describes everything the reviewers need to know.
- Your PR follows the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- The linter does not fail (or at least not because of your PR).
- You avoided the usage of an external dependency (only use one if you need to).

### Environment files

We use `.env` files to store sensitive data or data that needs to be changed for certain environments (like Windows users).

To override a value from a `.env` file, create a `.env.local` file (which will not be committed on GitHub). Do not directly modify the `.env` file.

### The database

This project currently uses MariaDB as database. You can easily access it with a friendly GUI thanks to PHPMyAdmin by going to `localhost:8080`.

Assuming you did not change the credentials in the root `.env` file :

- Server : `db` (this is the name of the service for your database),
- User : `root`,
- Password : `root`.

You can then access the current database named `app`. Another table called `app_test` can also appear after running tests.

> **Note**  
> The database is kept on your host in a `data` folder at the root of the project.

### IDEs

You can use any IDE you'd like. We of course recommend VSCode, which this project already includes a `settings.json` file for with everything configured.

Feel free to add documentation for your IDE here.

#### VSCode

The configuration for VSCode is already set and ready to use in `.vscode/settings.json`. Simply copy it from the `.vscode.dev` folder.

Of course, it will require some VSCode extensions to work properly :

- [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) for Dockerfile and docker-compose files support,
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for formatting generic and template files (twig, JSON, SCSS, etc...),
- [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=junstyle.php-cs-fixer) for PHP files linting,
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) for Typescript and Svelte files linting.

That should be all you need.

> **Note**  
> For the PHP-CS-Fixer extension, you will need to change the value for `php-cs-fixer.executablePath` and add the absolute path to the project on your disk.  
> You can adjust the other settings however you want.

### Additional documentation

> **Note**  
> All the additional documentation is located in the `docs` folder.
